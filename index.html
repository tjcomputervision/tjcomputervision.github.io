         <h2> Welcome to TJHSST Computer Vision Club! </h2>
         <p> Computer Vision Club meets every Wednesday B block. We focus on the theory of human and computer vision
            and its applications. Our goal is to create a fun, engaging environment where all members can acquire the
            necessary skills and experience to use CV for their projects and research.
         </p>
         <h2> Why Computer Vision? </h2>
         <p> The purpose of computer vision is to extract information from real-world content and use it to solve
            real-world problems-- for instance, image reconstruction, anomaly detection, and autonomous driving. In
            the past few years, CV's popularity and potential began to spike as computational platforms became more
            powerful and new ideas were developed. TJ Computer Vision Club seeks to teach members the needed knowledge to
            so they can join this hype.
         </p>
         <h2> Our Plan </h2>
         <p> In the fall, we will mainly focus on human and computer vision theory, such as the camera model, feature
             extraction, and motion. In the spring, we will explore broader, more complex topics such as object detection
             and AI-based image processing.
          </p>
         <p> We will ensure that all lecture content can be understood without any background other than that previously
             presented. Additionally we will host competitions on Kaggle, a data science competition site and keep track
             of a rankings system, which will play a factor in officer determination for next year.
         </p>

         <h2> Programming Languages </h2>
         <p> We use Python3. If you do not have Python3, you must install it following the instructions at
            <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/"> https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>. Installing
            Python3 also installs pip3, which you will be using to install other libraries.
         </p>
         <p> If you are considering extensively using OpenCV on your own, we recommend C++ as the more advanced
             OpenCV modules are written in that.
         </p>
         <h2> Installing Libraries </h2>
         <p> Numpy provides a powerful framework for vector/matrix math. It can be installed using: <br/>
             <span style="background-color: #D3D3D3">pip3 install numpy</span> <br/>
             OpenCV is a robust computer vision library. To install it, use: <br/>
             <span style="background-color: #D3D3D3">pip3 install opencv-python</span> <br/>
             OpenCV provides comprehensive installation tutorials for C++ for Linux, MacOS, and Windows at
             <a href = "https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.2/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html"> https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.2/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html</a>.
         </p>
         <h2> Accessing TJ's Resources </h2>
         <p> TJ's machines run on linux and have multiple cores. They can be accessed via
             <span style="background-color: #D3D3D3">ssh username@remote.tjhsst.edu</span>. To copy a file
             from your personal computer to a TJ computer, use <span style="background-color: #D3D3D3">scp filename username@remote.tjhsst.edu:filepath</span>.
             To copy a folder, add the optional -r after scp. </p>
         <p> zoidberg is the only computer at TJ with a modern GPU. To access it, first ssh into the network,
             then <span style="background-color: #D3D3D3">ssh zoidberg</span>.
         </p>
         <h2> Mathematical References </h2>
         <p> Computer Vision involves vector/matrix algebra and single/multivariable calculus. We will cover the
            basics in our lectures. If you want more in-depth, rigorous apporaches, refer to
